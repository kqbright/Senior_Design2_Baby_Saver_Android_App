=========Background=====================
My team was givin a task to create
a device that could be attached to
a baby car seat to warn parents
when they left the baby in the car.
We used an Arduino Uno to send data
from sensors connected to the car seat.
Once the data is collected it is sent 
over Bluetooth to our Android App.

==========Comments======================
I'm posting this code, because we spent
hours trying to get the Bluetooth to connect
correctly without any errors. You are welcomed
to use this code at free will for any project.
I suggest you keep it open sourced! We used
Eclipse with the ADT to program our app. You 
can download our workspace and run the app
and review our code. It is commented a little
to help guide you through the code.

==========Work Space Instructions=======
In Eclipse Import the AppWorkspace folder as
a workspace. This will give you access to
everything that we coded to make the app.

==========BabySaver.apk Instructions====
To run the app that we created on your phone
without using Eclipse, open the BabySaver.apk
file on your Android device running at minimum
Android 4.1 (JellyBean). This will install the
application to your device.

========================================
Hope this is somewhat educational to someone.
